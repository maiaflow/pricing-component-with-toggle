## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS (which i know could have been more concise, or omitted!)

### What I learned

I learned about how checkboxes can be used and transformed to create interactivity mostly through CSS.

### Continued development

I'd like to learn how to do something like this without any JS. 

### Useful resources

- [Codepen - Check it toggle example](https://codepen.io/kerns/pen/WNvwze) - We used this resource to build our toggle button
